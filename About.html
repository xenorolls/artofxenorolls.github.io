            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br  />
            <p>
              My name is Francis Fang. I am 3D artist, with a focus on 3D modelling and have experience with 3D animation.
            </p>

            <br  />
            
            <p>
              In my youth, I grew fascinated with the 3D world and how it shaped the work within films, shows, and video games, from model makers making props to an artist creating fully rendered characters for use in animation or green screen editing. I started to model on my own, starting out with sculptures made of foil and small, simple clay models. As I grew, I soon advanced in other forms of art and media, before settling within the world of 3D by the time I had entered college.
            </p>

            <br  />
            <p>
              When it comes to 3D modeling, I take delight and joy in taking my ideas and inspirations from the sketch to the final design. To see another world come to life, the stories that are shown, the expressions of each character model is what I enjoy doing when undertaking a project within the 3D space. In my spare time, I enjoy watching films and shows, playing video games, or spending time with my dog and cats. These pastimes donâ€™t just serve as simple time-killers or brief respite, they act as a gateway or starting point for new ideas to inspire projects yet to come.
